Market Segmentation Analysis in Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the market segmentation case study from the book Market Segmentation Analysis by Sara Dolnicar, Bettina Gr√ºn, and Friedrich Leisch. The original case study and code are in R, and this project replicates the analyses and visualizations using Python.
